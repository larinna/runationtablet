The last year has been harrowing for refugee families around the world. Forced to flee their homes by violence, refugee families leave their home with only what they can carry, lacking the very basics of survival.From Africa to South East Asia, the Middle East to Europe, UNHCR is providing vital supplies to keep refugee families safe, well nourished and healthy in extreme conditions.Your generous donation of a food and water, winter or healthcare package can ensure that refugee families suffering from extreme conditions can survive the coming months and into the future.
